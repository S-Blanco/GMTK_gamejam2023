The unremarkable adventures of goodenough the sword
==

This repository contains our gamejam submission for the [2023 GMTK gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) themed was *Roles Reversed*.

In this game, you play as a wandering sword longing to see the world.
Goblins, dragons or krakens, you want to see them all.
Ready for adventure, you're afraid of nothing! Nothing?
Well...
Almost nothing...
Imagine being such a lousy sword that you end up being used as a fire poker at an Inn. Hearing everyone else's achievements with no hope of joining.
Or worse, imagine becoming so famous that some king kidnaps you to be displayed in an old castle room! You wouldn't even hear about adventures!
Play your hand (and adventurer) well and you might be just good enough to be kept around for as long as you want.
